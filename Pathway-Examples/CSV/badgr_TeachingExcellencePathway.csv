OER are teaching, learning, and research resources released under an open license that permits their free use and repurposing by others. These can include open access scholarly and educational resources and texts that faculty create themselves. 



The goal of the badge is to incentivize faculty members to adopt, adapt, and create alternatives to high priced commercial textbooks. The tiers will be determined by whether projects focus on revising and remixing resources to creating new open content or projects that result in substantially new open textbooks. Encouraging faculty members to create or adapt OER reduces cost barriers and allows every student immediate and unlimited access to learning materials from day one of a class.",,OpenBadge,,,,,
