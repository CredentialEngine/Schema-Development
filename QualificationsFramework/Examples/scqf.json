			"ceasn:description": { "en": "Following an extensive and rigorous review process, the SCQF Level Descriptors were revised in 2012. This glossary provides an explanation of terms used in describing them. Consultation during the review indicated a general consensus amongst users and Practitioners that a glossary of key terminology used in the Descriptors would be extremely helpful, serving to assist and clarify interpretation in context. This glossary draws on pre-existing SCQF glossaries, standard dictionary definitions and, crucially, the context in which the term is being used. It is designed as a pragmatic tool to assign meanings to words in a highly specific context - that of the SCQF Level Descriptors. As such, its definitions are not absolute; rather, they are intended to amplify and decode the Descriptors. The review was conducted on the basis that any change to the Descriptors must not be made simply for its own sake. This has had implications for the glossary which, in seeking to standardise and explain usage within the Descriptors, works with the grain of terms already in use rather than import new ones which could, potentially, destabilise the Descriptors. The glossary is not comprehensive: only the terms which require contextualisation, explanation or mitigation regarding their use or meaning in the context of the SCQF Level Descriptors have been included. However, further terms could be added in a subsequent edition, subject to demand. In using the glossary four key factors should be kept in mind: • the Level Descriptors are for guidance only - it is not expected that every point will necessarily be covered; • context is absolutely key - much depends on the focus of the Characteristic and/or Level Descriptor in which the term is applied; • the terms are used in a broadly linear manner from least to most advanced across the Level Descriptors for each Characteristic, but no term is exclusively the domain of one particular level; and • from the point of view of the terminology used, each Characteristic is a separate strand and the sequencing described in the glossary does not automatically work between the Characteristics." },
