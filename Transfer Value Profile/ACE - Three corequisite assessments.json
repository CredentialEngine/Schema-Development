			"Description": "The Professional Aviation Maintenance Association is the sponsoring organization in conjunction with the Federal Aviation Administration who manages and administers the examinations. The Federal Aviation Administration issues mechanic certificates in accordance with Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 65, Subpart D, Mechanics. The mechanic certificate is divided into two ratings, airframe and power plant. Each rating grants the holder specific responsibilities and privileges identified in the rule. The mechanic can choose only to be airframe or power plant rated, or hold both the airframe and power plant rating. However, the majority of individuals test for both the Airframe and power plant ratings because more employment opportunities are open to them. To become a certificated mechanic an individual must be eligible and successfully pass a series of written, oral, and practical tests. Airframe rating qualifies the certificate holder to work on all parts of an aircraft except the power plants and propellers. A holder of a power plant certificate is restricted to work on only power plants and propellers. To be eligible to sit for the examinations an individual must be a graduate of an FAA Approved Part 147 Aviation Maintenance Technician School (AMT), or demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FAA that he or she has 18 months practical experience working on airframes or power plants, or 30 months working concurrently on airframes and power plants. Part 147 of title 14, CFR require the AMT School teach an approved curriculum for a minimum of 1900 hours. To sit for the A&P examination based on practical experience the applicant must show 4800 hours of aviation maintenance experience working on airframes and power plants. This practical experience can be earned either in the military or in industry. The FAA's Airframe and power plant Examination is composed of three major parts: Written, Oral, and Practical and covers 43 subject areas from wood working to turbine engines to electrical. The written examination is further divided into Airframe, power plant, and General. For example if an individual wanted to sit for the A&P examination he or she would have to take three (3) computer-based, multiple-choice, question parts. After successfully completing the written examination, the individual would take both the oral and practical parts from a FAA Designated Mechanic Examiner, or FAA Aviation Safety Inspector (Airworthiness).",
