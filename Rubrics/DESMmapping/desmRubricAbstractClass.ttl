    dcterms:description """This concept scheme identifies the abstract class of Rubric and may include any rubric-associated classes beyond an encompassing Rubric such as Criteria, Criteria Levels, and Criteria Categories etc. necessary to the description of a rubric's entities, components and relationships. As used here, the term Rubric explicitly EXCLUDES: (1) the abstract class of Assessment or any other class that may rely on or reference the Rubrics being crosswalked or their components; (2) aspects of the data models being crosswalked that are not central to the rubric domain such as progression models or controlled vocabularies referenced by a Rubric; and (3) Agents being assessed or doing the assessing (including self-assessment) using the rubric. Research reveals three types of rubrics within scope: (1) analytic rubrics, (2) holistic rubrics, and (3) primary trait rubrics.
