# List of properties that should be considered for any creative work

[propertiesForCreativeWorks.csv](./propertiesForCreativeWorks.csv) is a list properties that may be useful for any type of "creative work", i.e. any document, report, policy or the like.

The idea is not that all the properties are used automatically, but that this list is pruned to those that are applicable.  To that end the CSV can be imported into a spread sheet and columns added with notes as to their suitability. In particular, where there are similar properties in the ceterms: and ceasn: namespaces be careful not to use both without a clear reason.

Before using, make sure that this list has been updated to reflect recent changes in CTDL.

Points to remember: 
- Some of the property definitions will need changin if their domain is extended.
- Several of the properties have inverse properties that should be considered for addition to other entity types when applicable.
